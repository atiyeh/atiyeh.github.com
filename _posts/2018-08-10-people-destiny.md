By the name of the most high 

Everything has been changed and it has made people a little different. I wish I was Albert Anishtine. I could be a clever man and a man who chose his life by himself and it is a big chance.in my country it is possible but extremely hard . powerful people have many  choice and be the winner in every situation
But the weak people should obey their destiny.
In this post I want to explain a very important thing that it has affected in our life this means that we canâ€™t choose who are going to be our parents or our name and very important thing our economy system. 
But in another way we can choose it we grow up actually and we choose who are going to be in the future .
